🚀 VectorForge ML
High-Performance Machine Learning Framework in C++
📌 Overview

VectorForge ML is a machine learning framework built from scratch in C++, focused on understanding the mathematical foundations of ML while designing a scalable and performance-oriented system.

Unlike traditional ML libraries that abstract away implementation details, this project emphasizes:

Manual implementation of core algorithms

Mathematical clarity

Optimization techniques

Clean modular architecture

Progressive system scaling

The goal is to evolve this project from a beginner-level implementation into a research-ready ML engine with performance benchmarking and optional R integration.

🎯 Project Vision

This project is being built in structured phases:

🌱 Beginner → Basic Linear Regression

🌿 Intermediate → Logistic Regression, K-Means

🌳 Advanced → Neural Networks, Optimization, Multithreading

📊 Research Level → Benchmarking + IEEE Paper

We are building this step-by-step to ensure deep understanding and strong engineering foundations.

The architecture is modular to allow scalable growth.

⚙️ How to Build
Using g++
g++ src/main.cpp src/linear_regression.cpp -o vectorforge
./vectorforge


(Advanced build system using CMake will be added in future versions.)

📊 Performance Philosophy

VectorForge ML is designed with:

Efficient memory usage

Manual vector operations

Gradient optimization techniques

Future support for multithreading

Benchmark comparison with native R implementations

Performance metrics will be published in later versions.

📘 Educational Purpose

This project is designed to:

Strengthen understanding of ML mathematics

Improve C++ engineering skills

Build systems-level optimization knowledge

Prepare for ML/Backend/Research roles

It is not meant to replace production ML libraries — it is meant to deeply understand and build one.
